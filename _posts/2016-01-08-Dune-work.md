Here I have put some links to Dune queries I have done while working at Summer.fi

These were not used to create any charts on Dune, but rather as a part of the data pipeline that ended up with charts in Tableau.
The data was extracted from Dune via the Dune API with a scheduled python script, pushed to the Snowflake data warehouse and loaded into Tableau.
