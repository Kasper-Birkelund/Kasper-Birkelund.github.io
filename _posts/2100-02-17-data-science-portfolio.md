Welcome to my portfolio!
Below you will find different projects I have been working on next to my Data Science position as a Data Scientist for FrieslandCampina in The Netherlands.

The last project consists of links to various guided project I did as a part of the Data Science path on the online learning platform, dataquest.io.
I also finished the classic "Introduction to machine learning" course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.com.
